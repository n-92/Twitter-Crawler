# Twitter-Crawler
A piece of code to search through twitter for food and drinks.  

TO RUN the script, open terminal and type 
> python tweet_crawler.py

It will print out all the tweets queried on terminal.  Sit back and relax.  Enjoy the show.  Once 6 hours is over, 
as specified in the code, the crawling will stop and you will see the message "DONE".
